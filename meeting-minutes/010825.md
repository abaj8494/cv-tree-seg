- formatted notebook
- implemented IoU

### what will you do before the next meeting

- implement morphology
- implement thresholding
- critically debug the correctness IoU

## Jing Jing

### what did you do since the last meeting

- IoU: 0.15 (accuracy)
- Loss Fn: (training; backpropagation )
    - Binary Cross Entropy
- no-pooling CNN
    - CNN layers: 4; 

Down sample with pooling 
    |                       | = MASK
        |                |
            |        |
