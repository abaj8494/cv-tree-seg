\section{Experimental Results}
Included below are all the experimental results proved by this table.
We report mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on test set.
Intersection-over-Union refers to the total percent of the true mask and the generated mask that overlap, divided by the size of both masks
For DeepLabV3+, the data are split \textbf{80/20} into training, validation.
