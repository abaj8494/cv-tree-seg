\section{Introduction}
Forest ecosystems are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change, with standing dead trees serving as critical indicators of forest health deterioration and key drivers of biodiversity loss. This report develops and compares the different methods in deep learning and machine learning for segmenting standing dead trees in aerial images of forests to monitor forest health and protect ecological benefits. The dataset we used to implement and evaluate is the four-band images recorded by a group of forest health experts, which provides 444 aerial images with corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks and includes RGB and near-infrared (NIR) channels data. The corresponding dataset can be downloaded from \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com}{Kaggle} and the relevant information can be found at \cite{b1}. This report complements our notebook and presentation.
